# lite-plugin-crystal

A plugin for the lite &amp; lite-xl editor providing syntax highlighting for the crystal language. Based on the currently existing ruby plugin.

## Installation

Add the language_crystal.lua file to your plugins directory and reload/restart the editor.

## Contributing

Please do contribute. I'm not very familiar with lua or crystal (yet).

Currently needed improvements:
- recognize interpolated values
- recognize function calls that are not preceded by '.' or have paranthesis
- check if the keywords are all correct
